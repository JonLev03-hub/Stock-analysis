# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview
In this project i have been creating stock analysis scripts in VBA to review data on 12 Green energy stocks. My goal is to create a script that can quickly review the stock data producing the annual volume for the stocks along with the return after one year. The code should also be able to format the results nicely so it is easily read. 

## Analysis
The results from the first script created are listed below.
